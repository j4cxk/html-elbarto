        <h2 class="hone">Biography</h2>
         <p class="pone">El Barto is the anonymous graffiti tag and alter ego of Bart Simpson, the mischievous son from The Simpsons. Defined by his simple, untraceable tag—a faux-Spanish moniker meaning "The Bart"—El Barto is the signature left after Bart's acts of petty vandalism, primarily targeting Springfield Elementary and its authority figures, particularly Principal Skinner. This secret identity allows Bart to engage in consequence-free self-expression, elevating his minor pranks into the work of a persistent, unsolved neighborhood legend who symbolizes the eternal, low-grade defiance of youth.</p>
